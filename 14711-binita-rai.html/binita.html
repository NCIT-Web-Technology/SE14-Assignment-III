					<h1>FORMATTING GUIDES FOR AUTHORS OF JGRCS MANUSCRIPT</h1>
					<p>All manuscripts must be in English. These guidelines include complete descriptions of the fonts, spacing, and related information for producing your proceedings manuscripts. 
This document describes, and is written to conform to, author guidelines for the JGRCS. It is prepared in Microsoft Word as a .doc document.  Although other means of preparation are acceptable, final, camera-ready versions must conform to this layout.  Microsoft Word terminology is used where appropriate in this document.  Although formatting instructions may often appear daunting, the simplest approach is to use this template and insert headings and text into it as appropriate. Some components, such as multi-leveled equations and graphics, are not prescribed, although the various table text styles are provided. The formatter will need to create these components, incorporating the applicable criteria that follow.
FORMAT & STYLE
Text of manuscript should be arranged in the following order: Title, Abstract, Introduction, Body Text, Results and Discussion, Conclusion, Acknowledgements and References.
Title (Heading 2)
Title should be short and explanatory enough. It should be typed as it is written in sample paper.
Abstract 
Abstract should be of no more than 150 words for brief reports and 250 words for original articles and other article types. The abstract should be structured for original articles. State the context (background), aims, settings and design, material and methods, statistical analysis used, results and conclusions. Below the abstract should provide 3 to 8 keywords. The abstract should not be structured for a brief report, review article, symposia and research methodology. Do not include references in abstract.
