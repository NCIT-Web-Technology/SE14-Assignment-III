		<h3><b>Establishment:</b></h3>

<hr>

		<p>Prior to the establishment of the first college in the country, Tri-Chandra College in 1918,
		higher education in Nepal was nonexistent. Until 1985, Tribhuvan University had remained the one 
		and the only university in Nepal. In the early 80s, His Majesty's Government developed the concept
		of a multi-university system for the country. One important assumption behind the concept was that 
		each new university should have a distinctive nature, content and function of its own.The first new 
		university that was established was Mahendra Sanskrit University. The inception of this university was 
		soon followed by Kathmandu University in 1990, Purbanchal and Pokhara Universities in 1995 and 1996 respectively.
		Many schools and colleges are run by private initiatives but none of the universities in Nepal are private.

 </p>
		<h4><b>Tribhuwan University:</b></h4>

		<p style="color:green">Tribhuvan University (TU) is the first national institution of higher education in Nepal.
		It was established in 1959 A.D. The Central Administrative Office and the Central Campus of the university are 
		located on the north eastern facade of Kirtipur, an ancient and small town located five kilometers away from Kathmandu
		city centre. There are 38 central departments and 4 research centres in TU, and out of them 31 departments and 3 research
		centres are located at Kirtipur. The university at Kirtipur is spread over an area of 154.77 hectares (3042-5-2 ropanis).</p>
<h4>	<b>Kathmandu University:</b>	</h4>
		
		<p style="color:green">Kathmandu University is an autonomous, not-for-profit, non - government institution dedicated to 
		maintain high standards of academic excellence. It is committed to develop leaders in professional areas through quality education.
		It is located in a mountainous landscape in Dhulikhel Municipality about 30 kilometers east of Kathmandu (KTM) having round-the-year 
		pleasant climate and panoramic Himalayan Views.KU had a very modest start from a rented building at Tangal, Kathmandu.
		Now, it has been able to create a built up space of 46,846 square meters.

</p>
		
		<h4><b>Pokhara University:</b></h4>
		<p style="color:green">

		Pokhara University (PU or PoU) was established in 1996 as Nepal's fifth University.
		The central office of this university is located in Pokhara, Kaski district, Western Development Region. 
		Along with Purbanchal University, PU was formed as part of the government's policy for improved access to higher education.
		The Prime Minister is the Chancellor of the University and the Minister for Education is the Pro-Chancellor. 
		The Vice Chancellor is the principal administrator of the university.

</p>

<h4>		<b>Purbanchal University:</b>		</h4>

			<p style="color:green">

			The establishment of Purbanchal University in 1993 was visualized as an extraordinary endeavour by
			the Government of Nepal to create an academic centre of excellence in the Eastern Development Region 
			of Nepal. Its prime role was outlined to act as a catalytic agent for the promotion of socio-economic
			transformation in Nepal through quality education appropriate for quality life and sustainable future.
			Since its establishment, the university is motivated by its fundamental objective of preserving, refining,
			inventing, adopting, extending and transmitting knowledge in an environment that fosters free enquiry and open
			scholarly debate, leading to all-encompassing development of the rural people and their economies and environment.
